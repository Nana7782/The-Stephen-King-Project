# The Stephen King Project

This project is dedicated to my favourite Author.

I've found an API online which I will use to create a page where you can search for books or characters and get a printable reading checklicst.

I'll use HTML, SCSS and Typescript, as well as the Stephen King API

I 'll do this to practice my typescript skills, before I'll start learning React.
